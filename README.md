## Milestone 1: Project Setup, Version Control, and Infrastructure as Code with Terraform

1. **Project Setup and Version Control:**
    - Create a new Google Cloud project.
      - Follow the steps to create a new project: https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate
      - Link a billing account to your google project
    - Create a service account:
      - Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/
      - Click on IAM & Admin
        ![Console](images/console.png)
      - Click on Service Accounts
        ![Service Account](images/service-account.png)
      - Create a new service account

      - Once the account is created, click on the service account and go to KEYS and click on ADD KEY
        ![Create Key](images/create-key.png)
      - Create a json key and once you click on create a credentials json file will be downloaded.

        - Cloud Dataproc API
        - Cloud Resource Manager API
        - Vertex AI API
        - Secret Manager API
        - Cloud Build API
        - IAM Service Account Credentials API
    - Set up a version control repository for code and documentation.
      - Follow the steps to create new repository: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo
      - Clone the repository to your local

        ```sh
        git clone <repo-name>
        ```

2. **Infrastructure as Code with Terraform:**
   - Prerequisites:
     - Install Terraform: https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads
   - Steps:
      - Create folder with name terraform.
      - Add service-account creds file and rename to `gcp-creds.json`.
      - Add train.csv file to data folder and preprocessing script to scripts folder.
      - Create a `main.tf` file with resource definitions (Feature Store, Dataproc, Bigquery).
      - Deploy the infra by applying terraform files.

      ```sh
      terraform init
      terraform apply -auto-approve 
      ```

      >NOTE:The file paths needs to be changed based on operating system, current paths are based on MAC environment, for Windows change accordingly.
